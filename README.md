# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Satellite-Image-Segmentation-and-Classification
 This report details a project that applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to the  segmentation and classification of satellite images. The project demonstrates how a Deep  Q-Network (DQN) can be trained in a custom environment to label patches of a satellite  image (e.g., building, road, vegetation, water).
